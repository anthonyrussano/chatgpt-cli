# it looks cool dont get me wrong... its just not anything close to mickey mouse

- **You:** it looks cool dont get me wrong... its just not anything close to mickey mouse
- **ChatGPT:** I apologize once again for the inadequate representation. ASCII art can be subjective and challenging to depict complex images accurately. If you're seeking an accurate representation of Mickey Mouse, I suggest looking for ASCII art specifically designed for this purpose on dedicated websites or forums. These platforms might have more accurate and recognizable designs.
