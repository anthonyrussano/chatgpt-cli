# In my Bible, Acts 4:36 says, "Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas..."

- **You:** In my Bible, Acts 4:36 says, "Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas..."
- **ChatGPT:** I apologize for the confusion. You are correct. In Acts 4:36, it is indeed mentioned that Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas. Barnabas is a name given to him by the apostles because it means "Son of Encouragement" in Greek. So, Joseph and Barnabas are the same person, known by both names in the Bible.
