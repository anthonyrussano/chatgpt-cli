Pentecost is a Christian holiday commemorating the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks. It's often described as the "birthday of the Church." It occurs 50 days after Easter Sunday and ten days after the Ascension of Jesus Christ. The term "Pentecost" is derived from the Greek word "pentēkostē", meaning "fiftieth".
